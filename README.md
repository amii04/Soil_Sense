# How to Use
Crop Prediction: Input State_Name, District_Name, and Season to get the predicted crop for that location.
Crop Recommendation: Input N, P, K, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall for that location to get recommended crops for that location.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Input Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture, Soil Type, Crop Type, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium to get recommended fertilizer for that crop and location.
